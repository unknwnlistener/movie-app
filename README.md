# React Movie Application

An IMDB clone application that uses the [TMDB](themoviedb.org) API to display movie details.

Run `yarn start` to start the application locally.

### Dev Notes

This was started as a coding challenge with Florin Pop back in October 2020 and never really completed. I would like to get back into this one and finish it up to a stage that it can be called functional at least. The date is currently 19-03-2021.
